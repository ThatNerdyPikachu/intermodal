.TH IMDL-TORRENT-CREATE "1" "April 2020" "Intermodal v0.1.6" "Intermodal Manual"
.SH NAME
\fBimdl\ torrent\ create\fR
- Create a .torrent file.
.SH "SYNOPSIS:"
.IP
imdl torrent create [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] \fB\-\-input\fR <PATH>
.SH "FLAGS:"
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Skip writing `.torrent` file to disk.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-follow\-symlinks\fR
Follow symlinks in torrent input. By default, symlinks to files and directories are not
included in torrent contents.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Overwrite the destination `.torrent` file, if it exists.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print help message.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\fR
Skip files listed in `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, and `git config \fB\-\-get\fR
core.excludesFile`.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-include\-hidden\fR
Include hidden files that would otherwise be skipped, such as files that start with a `.`,
and files hidden by file attributes on macOS and Windows.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-include\-junk\fR
Include junk files that would otherwise be skipped.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-md5\fR
Include MD5 checksum of each file in the torrent. N.B. MD5 is cryptographically broken and
only suitable for checking for accidental corruption.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-created\-by\fR
Do not populate `created by` key of generated torrent with imdl version information.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-creation\-date\fR
Do not populate `creation date` key of generated torrent with current time.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-open\fR
Open `.torrent` file after creation. Uses `xdg\-open`, `gnome\-open`, or `kde\-open` on
Linux; `open` on macOS; and `cmd \fI\,/C\/\fP start` on Windows
.TP
\fB\-\-link\fR
Print created torrent `magnet:` URL to standard output
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-private\fR
Set the `private` flag. Torrent clients that understand the flag and participate in the
swarm of a torrent with the flag set will only announce themselves to the announce URLs
included in the torrent, and will not use other peer discovery mechanisms, such as the DHT
or local peer discovery. See BEP 27: Private Torrents for more information.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-show\fR
Display information about created torrent file.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version number.
.SH "OPTIONS:"
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-allow\fR <LINT>...
Allow `LINT`. Lints check for conditions which, although permitted, are not
usually desirable. For example, piece length can be any non\-zero value, but
probably shouldn't be below 16 KiB. The lint `small\-piece\-size` checks for
this, and `\-\-allow small\-piece\-size` can be used to disable this check.
[possible values: private\-trackerless, small\-piece\-length, uneven\-piece\-length]
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-announce\fR <URL>
Use `URL` as the primary tracker announce URL. To supply multiple announce
URLs, also use `\-\-announce\-tier`.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-announce\-tier\fR <URL\-LIST>...
Use `URL\-LIST` as a tracker announce tier. Each instance adds a new tier. To
add multiple trackers to a given tier, separate their announce URLs with
commas:
.TP
`\-\-announce\-tier
udp://example.com:80/announce,https://example.net:443/announce`
.TP
Announce tiers are stored in the `announce\-list` key of the top\-level metainfo
dictionary as a list of lists of strings, as defined by BEP 12: Multitracker
Metadata Extension.
.TP
Note: Many BitTorrent clients do not implement the behavior described in BEP
12. See the discussion here for more details:
https://github.com/bittorrent/bittorrent.org/issues/82
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-comment\fR <TEXT>
Include `TEXT` as the comment for generated `.torrent` file. Stored under
`comment` key of top\-level metainfo dictionary.
.TP
\fB\-\-node\fR <NODE>...
Add DHT bootstrap node `NODE` to torrent. `NODE` should be in the form
`HOST:PORT`, where `HOST` is a domain name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address
surrounded by brackets. May be given more than once to add multiple bootstrap
nodes.
.IP
Examples:
.IP
\fB\-\-node\fR router.example.com:1337
.IP
\fB\-\-node\fR 203.0.113.0:2290
.IP
\fB\-\-node\fR [2001:db8:4275:7920:6269:7463:6f69:6e21]:8832
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-glob\fR <GLOB>...
Include or exclude files that match `GLOB`. Multiple glob may be provided, with
the last one taking precedence. Precede a glob with `!` to exclude it.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR <PATH>
Read torrent contents from `PATH`. If `PATH` is a file, torrent will be a
single\-file torrent.  If `PATH` is a directory, torrent will be a multi\-file
torrent.  If `PATH` is `\-`, read from standard input. Piece length defaults to
256KiB when reading from standard input if `\-\-piece\-length` is not given.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR <TEXT>
Set name of torrent to `TEXT`. Defaults to the filename of the argument to
`\-\-input`. Required when `\-\-input \-`.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR <TARGET>
Save `.torrent` file to `TARGET`, or print to standard output if `TARGET` is
`\-`. Defaults to the argument to `\-\-input` with an `.torrent` extension
appended. Required when `\-\-input \-`.
.TP
\fB\-\-peer\fR <PEER>...
Add `PEER` to magnet link.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-piece\-length\fR <BYTES>
Set piece length to `BYTES`. Accepts SI units, e.g. kib, mib, and gib.
.TP
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR <SPEC>...
Set the order of files within a torrent. `SPEC` should be of the form
`KEY:ORDER`, with `KEY` being one of `path` or `size`, and `ORDER` being
`ascending` or `descending`. `:ORDER` defaults to `ascending` if omitted. The
`\-\-sort\-by` flag may be given more than once, with later values being used to
break ties. Ties that remain are broken in ascending path order.
.IP
Sort in ascending order by path, the default:
.IP
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR path:ascending
.IP
Sort in ascending order by path, more concisely:
.IP
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR path
.IP
Sort in ascending order by size, break ties in descending path order:
.IP
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR size:ascending \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR path:descending
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-source\fR <TEXT>
Set torrent source to `TEXT`. Stored under `source` key of info dictionary.
This is useful for keeping statistics from being mis\-reported when
participating in swarms with the same contents, but with different trackers.
When source is set to a unique value for torrents with the same contents,
torrent clients will treat them as distinct torrents, and not share peers
between them, and will correctly report download and upload statistics to
multiple trackers.
